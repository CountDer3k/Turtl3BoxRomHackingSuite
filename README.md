# Turtl3Box Rom Hacking Suite
A Pokemon ROM Hacking Suite written in Java.

The Suite should be one program once its all completed, and it'll allow you to load your ROM and edit everything from one User Interface. I may also include each program as a standalone program incase you already have a favorite editor for another tools (but mine will be better ;) )

Now you can edit ROM Hacks on Mac or Linux, or even Windows 10 (Since most tools run into issues past XP & 7)

Be aware that this is a long development cycle. Some of the tools will be developed quickly, and other may take a long time.
Longest taks will be:
  - T3-Map
  - T3-Scripter
  - T3-PokemonEditor
  - T3-TrainerEditor (but others exists cross platform, so you can wait on this one)

ROM support will roll out after enough progress is made for either a single tools or the whole suite. Currently FireRed will be the only supported ROM.
